🎮 Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic interactive memory challenge where players test and improve their concentration by repeating an ever-growing sequence of lights and sounds. With every correct repetition, the sequence becomes longer and more complex — pushing memory and reaction skills to the limit.

🔥 Features

Dynamic sequence generation that increases difficulty each round

Visual and audio cues for intuitive gameplay

Responsive button interaction with animations

Game-over detection with restart functionality

💡 How It Works

The game highlights a random colored button along with a corresponding sound.

The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

Each successful round increases the sequence length.

A wrong input ends the game — but the player can restart anytime.
